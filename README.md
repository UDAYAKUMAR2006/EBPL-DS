Objective: Predict the likelihood and severity of road accidents using AI to improve traffic safety and prevent incidents.

Data Used: Historical traffic accident data with features like weather, time, road type, and location.

Process:

Data collection and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find patterns

Feature engineering for model input

Model training and evaluation (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)

Deployment via Streamlit for real-time prediction

Outcome:

Predict accident severity based on real-world inputs

Identify high-risk conditions and times

Provide insights for traffic management and public safety

Impact:

Supports smarter decision-making for drivers and authorities

Aims to reduce accident rates through early prediction and awareness# EBPL-DS-AI-DRIVEN TRAFFIC ACCIDENT
